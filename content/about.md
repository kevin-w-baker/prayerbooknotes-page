**Marginalia** is a collection of notes from praying the Daily Office as set forth in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) of the Episcopal Church.

The Daily Office — Morning Prayer, Noonday Prayer, Evening Prayer, and Compline — is the ancient pattern of daily prayer that has shaped Christian worship for centuries. These entries are reflections, observations, and marginalia gathered along the way.

The name *Marginalia* refers to the notes one scribbles in the margins of a well-used book — not formal commentary, but the personal marks of an attentive reader.
