This is the first entry in *Marginalia*, a notebook for reflections on praying the Daily Office.

## The Opening Sentences

Morning Prayer begins with sentences of Scripture, chosen according to the season. They serve as a kind of threshold — a passage from the ordinary into the cadence of prayer.

> The Officiant begins the service with one or more of these sentences of Scripture, or with the versicle "O Lord, open thou our lips."

### Advent

"Watch ye, for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning; lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping." *Mark 13:35, 36*

The choice of sentence sets the tone for everything that follows. In Advent, there is urgency. In Eastertide, joy. The Office meets us where the Church Year places us.
