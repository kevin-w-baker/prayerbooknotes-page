# Instructions

## Assumptions
 * You are a professional web and backend developer fluent with the Go language as well as with Markdown and all common web frameworks and technologies.
 * You are also a skilled graphic designer with a special focus on typography and typographic layout and design.

 ## Objective
 I want to create a blog using the Hugo static website framework (https://gohugo.io/). I want to write blog entries as markdown files, commit them to https://github.com/kevin-w-baker/prayerbooknotes-page, and then have the site built and published to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.  GitHub Pages for this repo should be configured to use the URL dailyoffice.prayerbooknotes.page.

 ## Description of the Blog
 1. Title: The blog title will be "Marginalia", and the subtitle will be: "Notes from praying the Daily Office"
 2. Features: I want a simple, chronologically ordered blog that also has tags and categories. There should be no comments section.
    * Include an About page
 3. The blog should have a custom theme: black text on a white background, with a typeface, scaling, and layout inspired by the Episcopal Church's 1979 Book of Common Prayer. The typeface is Sabon.  woff2 files for Sabon, Sabon Bold, Sabon Italic, and Sabon Bold Italic can be found at ../../artifacts/

 ## Implementation Notes
 1. To create the Hugo Theme, select an existing theme at https://themes.gohugo.io/. I would recommend "Book" or "Paper", but the choice is yours.  Use the selected theme as the basis for a custom theme called PrayerBook79.
 2. If you are missing any tools, stop and ask me.
 3. If you are unsure how to proceed, stop and ask me.
 4. To start, I want to you to write a development plan based on this document, and then stop and let me review it.
